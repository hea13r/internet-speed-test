This program will test your download and upload speed using python's speedtest library (will need to be installed through pip)

It also uses threading so while it is checking download speed it will also print a v every second and while testing upload it will print a ^ every second

To run, just download, and run from command line using this syntax: python3 speed.py
You will need to install speedtest-cli through pip in order to import speedtest
